# Weston Guides
I like learning things, specifically programming related things. It's really fun. :D. But sometimes you want to learn something and the resources for learning that something are scattered around on 50 different websites and it really sucks. Like earlier I was looking up how to split the window in vim and found like 30 different ways to do it and in the end I kind of understood how it was done but I'll probably forget some things next time I want to do it and then go googling again and forget which of the 30 ways was the way I did it before and that really sucks. 

So. This is where I keep basically everything I want to remember when I go learning programming things. Despite what the name suggests, I accept pull requests if you so wish to create one. My hope is to grow this into a fairly extensive set of guides for everything software development related. 

I think that's all. Let me know if I suggest something you think sucks. Not sarcasm, for all I know I'm stupid for also not thinking it sucks.
